# OpenAI Chat Assistant Setup Guide

## 🚀 **Getting Your OpenAI API Key**

### Step 1: Create OpenAI Account
1. Go to [https://platform.openai.com/](https://platform.openai.com/)
2. Sign up or sign in to your OpenAI account
3. Complete any verification steps if required

### Step 2: Get Your API Key
1. Navigate to **API Keys** in your dashboard
2. Click **"Create new secret key"**
3. Give your key a descriptive name (e.g., "Playground AI Chat")
4. **Copy the API key** (it starts with `sk-`)
5. **Save it securely** - you won't be able to see it again!

### Step 3: Add API Key to Your Project
Since environment files are restricted, you'll need to add the API key directly to the code temporarily:

**Option A: Direct in Code (Quick Setup)**
```typescript
// In app/api/chat/route.ts, line 7
const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: 'sk-your-actual-api-key-here', // Replace with your key
});
```

**Option B: Environment Variable (Recommended for Production)**
1. Create a `.env.local` file in your project root
2. Add: `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here`
3. Update the code to use: `apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY`
